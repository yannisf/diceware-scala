# How I introduced a React UI from scratch

1. Consumed the [Main Concepts](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html). 
The tutorial seemed to steep for me and the `create-react-app` hide many things under the cover.
1. Progressed with CDN libraries and react components as js functions
1. Converted the js functions to jsx and classes. Added babel from CDN.
1. Added bootstrap from CDN.
1. Added a bootswatch theme from CDN.
1. Added Axios from CDN
1. Introduced `npm` and webpack following guides such as:
   - https://medium.com/swlh/a-complete-webpack-setup-for-react-e56a2edf78ae
   - https://www.valentinog.com/blog/babel/
1. Gradually imported all libraries from `npm` and now building bundle with `webpack`.
1. Added jquery/popper to support bootstrap js
1. Introduce typescript (wip)
